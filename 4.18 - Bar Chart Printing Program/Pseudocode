One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs
and bar charts. Write a program that reads five numbers (each between 1 and 30). For each number
read, your program should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks. For example,
if your program reads the number seven, it should print *******.

    
    Set line counter  to zero
    Set asterisk counter to zero
    Input a  number between 1 and 30
    If number is greater than 1 and less than 30
    For counter i between one and five , increase i by one
        For counter j   between one and number inputted increase counter by 1
        Print ( * )
    Input next number
