Write a program that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
a) Product number
b) Quantity sold for one day
Your program should use a switch statement to help determine the retail price for each product.
Your program should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold last week.

    Initialize total retail value to zero
    Initialize retail value per day to zero
    for each day of the week
        Input product number
        Input quantity sold for one day 
        while the user has not yet entered sentinel to end program
            switch(product number)
                for case where product number is equal to 1
                    retail price is $2.98
                for case where product number is equal to 2
                    retail price is $4.50
                for case where product number is equal to 3
                    retail price is $9.98
                for case where product number is equal to 4
                    retail price is $4.49
                for case where product number is equal to 5
                    retail price is $6.87
                default case
                    print product number is from 1 to 5
                    retail price is zero
            Retail value is equal to quantity sold for one day times retail price
            Add retail value to retail value per day
            Input product number
            Input quantity sold for one day 
    Add retail value to total retail value
