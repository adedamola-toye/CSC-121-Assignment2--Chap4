 Collecting money becomes increasingly difficult during periods of recession, so companies may tighten their credit limits to prevent their accounts receivable
(money owed to them) from becoming too large. In response to a prolonged recession, one company
has cut its customers’ credit limits in half. Thus, if a particular customer had a credit limit of $2000,
it’s now $1000. If a customer had a credit limit of $5000, it’s now $2500. Write a program that
analyzes the credit status of three customers of this company. For each customer you’re given:
a) The customer’s account number.
b) The customer’s credit limit before the recession.
c) The customer’s current balance (i.e., the amount the customer owes the company).
Your program should calculate and print the new credit limit for each customer and should
determine (and print) which customers have current balances that exceed their new credit limits.

    Initialize newCreditLimit to zero
    
    For each customer counter  between one to three,      increase i by 1
        Input customer's account number
        Input credit limit before recession (oldCreditLimit)
        Input customers current credit balance ( the amount the cutsomer owes the company)
        Set newCreditLimit to oldCreditLimit divided by 2
        Print newCreditLimit

        If  current credit balance is greater than new credit limit
            Print "WARNING: This customer has exceeded its new credit limit
        else
            Print "This customer has not yet exceeded his  new credit limit
